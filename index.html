                        Individually or in a group find as many different examples as you can of physical controls and displays.
                    </p>
                    <p>(a) List them. - gauges, Lcd screen, car, whistles (b) Try to group them, or classify them. - analogue: Gauges, Digital display: Lcd Screen, Sounds: whistles (c) Discuss whether you believe the control or display is suitable for its
                        purpose - Analogue: gauges Is to gain a quick overview of measurement parameters - Digital display: Lcd screen Allow the image on a sign to be changed by electronic control methods. - Sounds: whistles Use for error indications
                        2) A typical computer system comprises a QWERTY keyboard, a mouse and a color screen. There is usually some form of loudspeaker as well. You should know how the keyboard, mouse and screen work. What sort of input does the keyboard
                        support? What sort of input does the mouse support? Are these adequate for all possible applications? If not, to which areas are they most suited? Do these areas map well onto the typical requirements for users of computer systems?
                        If you were designing a keyboard for a modern computer, and you wanted to produce a faster, easier-to-use layout, what information would you need to know and how would that influence the design? What sort of input does the keyboard
                        support? -shortcuts and key bindings. What sort of input does the mouse support? -select files and move it together. Are these adequate for all possible applications? -possible yes or no depending on the application were use. Do
                        these areas map well onto the typical requirements for users of computer systems? -yes, since it is modern. - I would separate the consonant and vowel and arrange them alphabetically but their connected in 1 cable.For me It could
                        be more faster than the modern keyboard but it require time to familiarize the key bindings since its my idea to build that kind of keyboard. 3) Pick one of the following scenarios, and choose a suitable combination of input and
                        output devices to best support the intended interaction. It may help to identify typical users or classes of user, and identify how the devices chosen support these people in their tasks. Explain the major problems that the input
                        and output devices solve. (a) Environmental database A computer database is under development that will hold environmental information. This ranges from meteorological measurements through fish catches to descriptions of pollution,
                        and will include topographical details and sketches and photographs. The data has to be accessed only by experts, but they want to be able to describe and retrieve any piece of data within a few seconds. (b) Word processor for
                        blind people A word processor for blind users is needed, which can also be operated by sighted people. It has to support the standard set of word-processing tasks. - Environmental database-the output of the environmental database
                        will depend on the current happenings and once the data transmit to the system the database will save and have a record for the recent happenings on environment. It could be useful from researchers including ecology, biology, physics,
                        chemistry, plant science, zoology, mineralogy, oceanography, limnology, soil science, geology and physical geography, and atmospheric science it could be an instrument from preventing disasters in our environment.
